Tags are used for the logic in your template. New tags are very easy to code, so I hope to get many contributions to the standard tag library after releasing this code.
Here is a list of currently supported tags:
assign - Assigns some value to a variable
capture - Block tag that captures text into a variable
case - Block tag, its the standard case...when block
comment - Block tag, comments out the text in the block
cycle - Cycle is usually used within a loop to alternate between values, like colors or DOM classes.
for - For loop
if - Standard if/else block
include - Includes another template; useful for partials
raw - temporarily disable tag processing to avoid syntax conflicts.
unless - Mirror of if statement
